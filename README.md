# ft_printf_42

The goal of this project was to implement a similar function to printf.
At the start of development, I took as a personal goal to achieve this assignment using only one file, following 42 Norm - one file can only contain 5 functions, which in turn can only have 25 lines. To succeed, I used various technical knowledge of the Clang and math-related and design pattern techniques. (description unfinished)
